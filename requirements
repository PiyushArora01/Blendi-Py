*****************************  REQUIREMENTS  ******************************

Along with the Recommended Versions:

Conda 4.3.23 ( Miniconda/ Anaconda )
Python 3.6.2 (64 Bit)

Tested using the following python library packages:

theano:      0.9.0
Keras:       2.0.6
Pillow:      3.1.1
scipy:       0.19.1
numpy:       1.13.1
matplotlib:  2.0.2
pandas:      0.20.3
statsmodels: 0.8.0
sklearn:     0.18.2


NOTE: It is mandatory to install (and update) all the above packages for the model to run and execute on your machine.

Also, it is advisable to install OPEN_CL or CUDA backend to utilize your Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) and thereby 
use it for intensive parallel computation invloved in this project model. Without a GPU support, the memory usage and CPU 
cycles will be highlyinvolved and occupied while running the L-BFGS optimization, and the performance may not be as expected.
